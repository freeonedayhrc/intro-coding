* Overview & Logistics

** What is Programming?

+ Programming /is/ the act of writing computer code
+ Programming is /about/ building and working with ideas
+ Programs are composed of /ideas/

** Why JavaScript?

Why not C, C++, Ruby, Perl, Python, Julia, Erlang, Haskell, Clojure, Scheme,
Java, PHP, C#, or Swift?

There are lots of great languages, but:

+ JS is one of the [[http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#tech-lang][the most popular languages in the world]]
+ JS runs everywhere!
  + Browsers, servers, microcontrollers, iOS, Android, and more
+ JS is /expressive/
  + Can represent ideas in natural/interesting ways

** Expectations

+ You will be writing actual *code*
+ Cannot become a programmer in two hours, but:
  + Get exposure to the basics
  + Can experience the process of coding
  + Have next steps

** Class Format

+ The lecture is meant to be /interactive/
  + Follow along with examples in lecture
  + Exercises throughout
+ *Do not hesitate to ask for help*
  + Public chat in lecture
  + Private chat (see link in video details)

** Topics Covered

+ *Data*: Primitives & Compound Data
  + Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Arrays, Objects
  + The /what/ of our programs
+ *Functions*: Building Blocks
  + The /how/ of our programs
  + Used to represent /ideas/

* Data and Data Structures

"Data" is what our programs store, manipulate, display and compute. Data is the
/subject/ of our programs.

*Question*: How can we represent characteristics of a *person* as data (e.g. Facebook profile)?

** Primitives: Numbers

#+begin_src javascript
1 + 3; // we can use operators to perform addition,
7 * 4 / 3 - 17; // multiplication, divisiion and subtraction
Math.floor(7.682); // There are many mathematical functions
#+end_src

+ Programming is /not/ all about math
  + But math is useful
+ Order of operations matters (PEMDAS)

** Exercises: Numbers

Do the following exercises at the console:

#+begin_src javascript
  // 1. What is the result of the following?
  5 + 7 * 8 - 5
  // 2. How about this? If they are different, why?
  (5 + 7) * (8 - 5)
  // 3. Translate your height from inches and feet to centimeters (or vice-versa)
  // if you already know your height in centimeters. There are 2.54cm per inch.
  // e.g. 6 feet, 1 inches is:
  ((6 * 12) + 1) * 2.54
#+end_src

** Primitives: Strings

#+begin_src javascript
"Hello, World!"; // a string
"Java" + "Script"; // "concatenation" of two strings with the "+" operator
"yay strings".length; // the length of the string can be computed
"make me uppercase".toUpperCase(); // There are many ways to transform text
#+end_src

+ Strings are used to represent text
+ We use double quotes to represent strings
  + Single quotes work too
+ There are [[http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp][lots]] of useful operations for working with strings

** Exercises: Strings

Do the following exercises at the console:

#+begin_src javascript
// 1. What happens when you use the '+' sign with strings?
"the quick " + "brown fox ..."
// 2. Enter your name as two strings, and use the '+' to combine them as you did above.
// 3. Find the length of your name with .length
// 4. Turn your name into upper case.
#+end_src

** Primitives: Booleans

#+begin_src javascript
true; // this is true
false; // this is false
true && false // logical "and"
true || false // logical "or"
!true // logical "not"
1 > 2;
3 <= 1000000;
4 === 4; // equality
"hello".length >= 5;
#+end_src

+ Booleans are how we talk about /logic/
+ The results of /comparisons/ are booleans

** Exercises: Booleans

Do the following exercises at the console:

#+begin_src javascript
  // 1. Try the following comparison. What is the result? Any idea why?
  "Bob" === "bob"
  // 2. How about this one?
  4 === "4"
  // 3. Try the following comparisons:
  1 > 2 || 5 > 2
  5 === 5 && 8 > 7
  !(1 > 2)
#+end_src

** Variables

#+begin_src javascript
var ten = 10; // create variable named `ten` and assign 10 to it.
var myName; // declares a variable without assigning anything
// assign "Josh Lehman" to the existing variable `myName`
myName = "Josh Lehman";
// variable names can be used to reference their values
myName.length > ten;
ten + 5;
ten; // ?
ten = ten + 5; // reassignment
ten; // ?
#+end_src

+ ~var~ is used to *create* a new variable
  + The ~=~ sign is called the /assignment operator/
+ Variables are used:
  + To associate /names/ with /values/
  + As storage locations
+ Variables can be /reassigned/

** Exercises: Variables

Do the following exercises at the console:

#+begin_src javascript
// 1. Create a variable called firstName, and assign your name to it.
// e.g. var firstName = "Josh"
// 2. Create a variable called lastName, and assign your name to it.
// 3. Create a variable called fullName, and assign your full name to it. Try
// using the firstName and lastName in conjunction with the '+' operator instead of rewriting
// your name.
// 4. Is your name longer than my name? Hint: use '.length' to compare the two.
var instructorName = "Josh Lehman";
#+end_src

** Interlude: Equality

#+begin_src javascript
var name = "Josh";
name === "Fred";
name = "Fred";
name === "Fred";
#+end_src

The ~=~ sign is the /assignment/ operator -- it /assigns/ what's on the right to
what's on the right.

We use ~===~ to /test for equality/.

** Compound Data: Objects

#+begin_src javascript
  var josh = {
    name: { first: "Josh", last: "Lehman" }, // nesting is ok!
    age: 26, // key-value pairs are separated with commas
    gender: "male",
    programmer: true
  }
  josh.age; // dot notation
  josh.name.first;
  josh["age"]; // bracket notation
  josh["name"]["first"];
  josh.name.first = "Joshua"; // we can reassign values!
#+end_src

+ Used to talk about entities
+ Comprised of /key,value/ pairs
  + /keys/ are usually represented as strings
  + Combine many kinds of data (hence, *compound*)
+ Access values by /key/:
  + Dot Notation: ~josh.age~, Bracket Notation: ~josh["age"]~

** Exercises: Objects

These exercises can be found in Codepen [[http://codepen.io/jlehman/pen/RrMBOv?editors=0010][here]].

** Compound Data: Arrays

#+begin_src javascript
var luckyNumbers = [12, 19, 7, 3, 28]; // comma separated!
var animals = ["monkey", "giraffe", "cat", "dog", "platypus"];
var people = [
  {name: "Ben Bitdiddle", age: 27},
  {name: "Eva Lu Ator", age: 32},
  {name: "Alyssa P. Hacker", age: 20},
  {name: "Louis Reasoner", age: 54}
];
animals[0]; // "monkey"
people[2]; // {name: "Alyssa P. Hacker", age: 20}
#+end_src

+ Arrays are used to represent /many/ things
  + The elements of arrays can be /anything/: numbers, strings, objects, etc.
+ Usually used to refer to many similar kinds of data
+ Elements are /indexed/ numerically from 0

** All Together Now

#+begin_src javascript
var josh = {
  name: {
    first: "Josh",
    last: "Lehman"
  },
  age: 26,
  gender: "male",
  programmer: true,
  favoriteTVShows: ["Fargo", "Breaking Bad", "Battlestar Galactica"],
  pets: [{type: "cat", name: "Pal", age: 3, biochipped: true, color: "orange"}]
}
josh.name.last; // "Lehman"
josh.favoriteTVShows[0]; // "Fargo"
josh.pets[0].type; // "cat"
#+end_src

** Exercises: All the data!

These exercises can be found in Codepen [[http://codepen.io/jlehman/pen/RrMBOv?editors=0010][here]].

** Recap

+ *Primitives* are the most basic data types
  + Numbers, Strings, Booleans
+ *Variables* are named storage locations
+ *Objects* represent data with multiple characteristics
+ *Arrays* represent many pieces of data (usually similar)
* Basics of Functions

/Functions/ allow us to represent a /task/ with a name and parameters.

** What are Functions?

#+begin_src javascript
// "definition" of function named square that accepts one argument
function square(x) {
  // Inside of the curly braces is called the "body"
  return x * x; // return specifies the "result"
}
// "invocation" of square function
square(5); // "invoking" is also known as "calling"
square(square(5));
#+end_src

+ Functions specify instructions to accomplish some task
+ Usually have a /name/
+ Usually have /arguments/ (the stuff inside the parenthesis)
+ Usually ~return~ a result

** Exercises: Basic Functions

These exercises can be found in Codepen [[http://codepen.io/jlehman/pen/RrMBOv?editors=0010][here]].

** Functions with Multiple Arguments

#+begin_src javascript
// Functions frequently have multiple arguments (separated by commas)
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
add(1, 2); // a: 1, b: 2, 1 + 2 => 3

function divide(x, y) {
  return x / y;
}
// The positions of arguments matters, not the names:
divide(9, 3) // x: 9, y: 3, 9 / 3 => 3
divide(3, 9) // x: 3, y: 9, 3 / 9 => 0.333333333
#+end_src

+ Functions can have multiple arguments
+ *Remember*: arguments are just named placeholders!
  + The values are supplied when the function is /invoked/ (or "called")

** Exercises: Functions with Multiple Arguments

These exercises can be found in Codepen [[http://codepen.io/jlehman/pen/RrMBOv?editors=0010][here]].

** Functions with Data Structures

#+begin_src javascript
// Functions frequently output data structures...
function makePerson(name, age, cats) {
  var person = {name: name, age: age, cats: cats};
  return person;
}
var johnDoe = makePerson("John Doe", 35, ["Fluffy"]);

// ... will often receive them as arguments...
function aboutPerson(person) {
  return person.name + " is " + person.age +
    " years old, and has " + person.cats.length + " cats.";
}
aboutPerson(johnDoe);

// ... and can manipulate them!
function hadBirthday(person) {
  person.age = person.age + 1;
  return person;
}
hadBirthday(johnDoe);
#+end_src

+ Data structures and functions work well together

** Exercises: Functions with Data Structures

These exercises can be found in Codepen [[http://codepen.io/jlehman/pen/RrMBOv?editors=0010][here]].

** Recap

+ *Functions* describe how to perform a task given arguments (parameters)
  + Don't solve the same problem multiple times: /use a function/
+ Functions can take multiple arguments
+ Arguments to and results from functions can be any kind of data
